The alias is used to assign the controller to a variable to be used in scope.

If you do this:

<ELEMENT ng-controller="myController as ctrl"> </ELEMENT>

Then you can use the variables defined in the controller inside the scope; this helps avoid problems with prototypal inheritance. It also makes the code ready for Angular 2, as they have removed $scope in Angular 2.

The alias abc is used as:

{{ abc.variableName }} 

instead of just {{ variableName }} in which case it's $scope.variableName.

An alias can be equivalently defined in the controller as:

$scope.aliasName = this;


Using aliases helps especially in cases where ng-model is used.
