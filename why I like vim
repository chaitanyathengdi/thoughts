Most people live hybrid lives, don't stick to one approach
E.g. clicking on a file and pressing <Shift> + <Delete>
On the console, all you have to do is type rm <entity>
Switching slows you down
If efficiency is important, then better to stick to one approach for everything and mouse is at times slower than keyboard
For hardcore programmers and general computer geeks, getting to be completely keyboard based is a good idea
