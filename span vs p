span has display property of inline, whereas p has display property of block.
when we use p to display text, we have to allocate separate block to it, causing formatting of the outer inline element(if any) to be messed up.
So, use nothing or span tags to write content in something that has external formatting.

Avoid displaying block element inside inline element. Block element goes into a new line, causing problems.
