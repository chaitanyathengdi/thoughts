Imagine you wake up to find yourself standing on the middle of a closed staircase that goes on up and down. There's only enough ambient light to see up to a couple of steps up or down; the remaining staircase is enveloped in darkness in both directions.
If you had to go two steps in either direction, which one would you go?
You don't have anywhere to go or any clue how you got there and how to get out; that's not the point of the scenario. It's just that you find yourself somewhere and you have two choices.

You'd choose to go down, because it's EASIER.
Man's natural instinct is to choose the path of least resistance. However, it's not necessarily the path that'll get him where he wants to go. If it's anywhere meaningful, it's usually the opposite; because accomplishing a goal takes planned effort.
